# quantchat
This project aims to develop a highly secure chat application using quantum cryptographic protocols like BB84 and quantum key distribution (QKD), far surpassing the security of traditional methods like AES and RSA. By leveraging quantum mechanics, our web-based platform ensures encrypted communication thatâ€™s nearly impossible to intercept or decode
